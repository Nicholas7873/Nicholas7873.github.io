				   <h2>Project Outline and Goal</h2>
				   <p>The goal of this project was to design a turbofan engine that would meet the requirements for Boom Technologies supersonic jet, Overture. Currently the Overture aircraft is set to fly with an engine designed by Rolls Royce. This project outlines an alternative engine option that may be used in its place if customers choose to do so. Some basic requirements for the engine include but are not limited to a cruise thrust of 80 kN at a cruise speed of mach 1.7 and a minimum takeoff thrust of 100 kN. In addition the engine needs to be as efficient and lightweight as possible in order for the Overture aircraft to meet its range requirement of 8000 km and maximum takeoff weight of 77 tons. For this report more emphasis will be placed on the overall engine performance rather than individual component performance. As such, efficiency values for components have been provided by UCI staff. Using these values and the fundamental equations for analyzing turbofan performance a number of factors, including maximum temperature, pressure ratio, bypass ratio, and fan pressure ratio, were analyzed to determine the best turbofan engine. </p>

				  <h2>Engine Presentation and Design Method</h2>
				  <p>The first step in designing the proposed engine is to determine the inlet parameters of the engine. By doing this the mass flow rate through the engine will be set allowing for the simplification of calculations further along in the design process. By choosing an inlet diameter the drag induced by the engine can also be taken into account allowing for more accurate calculations when it comes to the efficiency of the engine. All of this can be achieved using the first section of equations listed above.</p>
				  <p>The next step in the engine design is going to be an analysis of the performance of the engine gas generator. This is essentially the core of the engine. It is important to note that there are many different ways in which the core engine gas generator can be designed. As such a wide range of engine parameters will be altered and their effects on engine performance will be examined to determine the best options. This will be done by ranging the maximum internal temperature and compressor compression ratio.</p>

				  <p>The next step will be to determine the bypass and fan pressure ratios for the outer portion of the engine. By adding a fan to the front of the engine more energy can be extracted from the hot gas created from the core gas generator thus improving efficiency. However, this requires additional power to be drawn from the hot gas and less mass flow rate through the core engine. As such a balance needs to be achieved. In order to find the ideal balance for the flight conditions and requirements laid out in this project a range of bypass and fan pressure ratios will be examined.</p>
				  <a><img src="images2/pic17.png" class="center" width="60%" height="60%" /></a>
				  <p>The final step is to analyze the efficiency of the engine. By creating contour plots using the performance parameters mentioned above a wide range of efficiencies can be analyzed. Ideally the values that these performance parameters are set to will yield the highest possible efficiency values while meeting the design requirements stated in this report so that the engine can be competitive on the market.</p>
