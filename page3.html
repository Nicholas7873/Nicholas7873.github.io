				<h2>Project Outline and Goal</h2>

				<p>In this project the effects of adding a rear wing to a high speed go kart were explored. The addition of rear wings to cars can prove to be advantageous for their performance. As such studying rear wing variations can prove to be highly insightful in the world of motorsport. The rear wing, in particular, that will be studied, will be modeled off of the NACA 2412 airfoil and its sizing will be based off of similar rear wings that are often attached to the chosen go kart. Unfortunately, due to sizing constraints as a result of the UCI wind tunnel's small test section, a scaled model of the rear wing needed to be constructed. This was done by ensuring that the Reynolds number and Aspect ratio of the model matched those of the actual rear wing. In order to test the full potential of the NACA 2412 airfoil three variations were used. These variations being a normal, symmetrical, and reverse airfoil. The ultimate goal being that these airfoil variants could be compared, with the best variant and angle of attack being chosen to maximize the performance of the go kart. Ultimately the results of this project were more similar than expected but unfortunately performance improvements were not found.</p>

				<h2>Performance Results Tabulated from Wind Tunnel Testing</h2>
				<p>By looking at the results above it was found that the maximum achievable acceleration for the go kart with a NACA 2412 variant wing installed occurs when the normal airfoil is at an angle of attack of -12 degrees, the symmetrical airfoil is at an angle of attack of -10.2 degrees, and the reverse airfoil is at an angle of attack of -10.5 degrees. At these angles of attack the maximum achievable acceleration by the airfoil variants are 8.9, 8.897, and 8.879 meters per second squared respectively. It is important to note that all of these values are lower than the maximum acceleration allowed by the original airfoil installed on the go kart. As such, for this go kart and the speed that it travels it can be determined that none of the NACA 2412 variants are viable options as a rear wing.</p>
